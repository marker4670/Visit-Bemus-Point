										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Join us for the Bemus Point Business Association’s Meet &amp; Greet!</h1>
<p>The Bemus Point Business Association (BPBA) is excited to announce that we are hosting our first inaugural Meet and Greet on Sunday, March 27<sup>th</sup> from 2-5PM at the Bemus Point Golf Club &amp; Tap House.</p>
<p>This Meet and Greet will provide an opportunity for community members and business owners to come together while learning about the Bemus Point Business Association’s mission, events, and projects. We encourage all interested parties to attend, light refreshments will be provided.</p>
<p>Announcements will begin at 3PM, during which we will be presenting this year’s official schedule of events sponsored by the BPBA.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in supporting Bemus Point’s small business community and events, there will also be an opportunity to become a social member of the BPBA for a $50 donation. Funds raised through this program will go towards future events, including our yearly 4<sup>th</sup> of July fireworks display.</p>
<p>Social members will receive special updates and newsletters regarding projects and events, the ability to participate on committees, and will be listed on a Thank You page on our website, www.visitbemuspoint.com. Members that sign up during the Meet and Greet will also be receiving a coupon book with specials from many Bemus Point businesses.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll visit Bemus Point for this free, fun and friendly event!</p>
